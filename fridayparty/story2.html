  <h1>Homeless population keeps growing despite City efforts</h1>

<p>Homelessness in New York City has been on the rise over the past five years.
  Even though numerous attempts to address the issue have been made by authorities,
  nothing seems to have had a long-lasting effect on reducing the amount of people
  staying in shelters.</p>

    “NYC is a ‘perfect storm’ of barriers including rising rents, lower wages and
    shrinking stock of affordable apartments”

<p>“It is difficult to say why it has risen so much in NYC when most of the nation
  has seen decreases. But NYC is a ‘perfect storm’ of barriers including rising
  rents, lower wages and shrinking stock of affordable apartments,” Padgett said.</p>

<p>In May 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced “Housing New York: A Five-Borough, Ten-Year Plan”, a $41 billion plan to build or preserve 200,000 affordable units. Two years later, in January 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a $20 billion plan to create affordable housing and address homelessness. In February 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced “Turning the Tide on Homelessness in New York City,” his plan for ending the use of cluster sites and commercial hotel facilities citywide, while opening 90 new borough-based shelters.</p>

<p>“For me, the more important question is what the city is not doing,” said Deborah Padgett, a New York University professor and researcher on homelessness. “It is not diverting funds and resources from the shelter system to pay for rental vouchers and supportive housing.”</p>

<p>The national policy pushed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is “housing first”, but Padgett said the city is defying this and hiding behind the legal “right to shelter” to defend its heavy emphasis on shelters.</p>
