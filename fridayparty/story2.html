<p>Homelessness in New York City has been on the rise over the past five years.
  Even though numerous attempts to address the issue have been made by authorities,
  nothing seems to have had a long-lasting effect on reducing the amount of people
  staying in shelters.</p>

<p>This is a link <a href="https://riseforclimate.org/" target="_blank">Rise for Climate</a> page.</p>

<p>“For me, the more important question is what the city is not doing,” said Deborah
  Padgett, a New York University professor and researcher on homelessness.
  “It is not diverting funds and resources from the shelter system to pay for rental
  vouchers and supportive housing.”</p>

<p>The national policy pushed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
  Development (HUD) is “housing first”, but Padgett said the city is defying this and
  hiding behind the legal “right to shelter” to defend its heavy emphasis on shelters.</p>

<p>“There is a ‘homeless services industry’ that has grown up since the 1990’s that
  depends on billions of public funds to keep it going,” she said. “The status quo
  satisfies more powerful interests than changing toward housing first and ending
  homelessness.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    “NYC is a ‘perfect storm’ of barriers including rising rents, lower wages and
    shrinking stock of affordable apartments”
  </blockquote>

<p>Explaining why homelessness in New York has been increasing for years on end is not
  an easy task, but according to Padgett it is caused by a mixture of several factors. </p>

<p>“It is difficult to say why so much in NYC when most of the nation has seen decreases.
  But NYC is a ‘perfect storm’ of barriers including rising rents, lower wages and
  shrinking stock of affordable apartments,” Padgett said.</p>
