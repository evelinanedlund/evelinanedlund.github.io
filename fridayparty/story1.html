    <p>The sweltering heat with temperatures soaring into the 90s did not stop an
      estimated 3,000 people from marching through Lower Manhattan on Thursday to
      protest politician’s unwillingness to tackle environmental issues – including
      global warming.</p>

    <blockquote>"There are a lot of people in New York who support
      the climate justice movement."</blockquote>

    <p>This weekend people are joining more than 800 actions in 91 countries under
      the banner of <a href="https://riseforclimate.org/" target="_blank">Rise for Climate</a> to demonstrate the urgency of the climate crisis.
      Actions in the US and around the world are happening on September 8, but in order
      to not conflict with the NYC Labor Day Parade organizers chose to hold the event
      in New York City on Thursday instead of during the weekend.</p>

    <!-- Here I have embedded a Youtube video from the event -->

    <p>The events are being coordinated by a group called 350.org which is an
      international environmental organization, but for every event there are several
      local organizers and volunteers involved as well.</p>

    <p>”I think it is very efficient that we are doing this because in New York there
      are a lot of people who support the climate justice movement,” said Maham Rasheda,
      16, who is a member of the non-profit organization Global Kids and was one of the
      speakers at the march.</p>

    <p>The Rise for Climate, Jobs and Justice march gathered people carrying creative
      banners, signs and costumes in Battery Park. Signs carrying messages such as
      “Make corporations pay for their damage” and “We rise against fossil fuels” were
      mixed with people dressed in costumes ranging from Mother Earth to jellyfishes.
      Their mutual aim was to urge politicians to immediately act on issues related to
      the environment and climate change.</p>

    <p>“It came to me that if we do not have clean air and clean water none of the other
      things I was fighting for are going to matter,” said Helen Sacks Heisler, 69, who
      attended the march and lives on the Upper West Side and have marched for many
      different causes over the past 40-something years. “So, we need to fix this first
      in order to focus on other issues.”</p>

<!-- Here is the last part of my article -->

    <p>Sacks Heisler is a grandchild of the holocaust as her parents came from Germany,
      and she said that she has been aware of injustice her whole life.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Political parties or stances should not matter in regard to this issue.”
      </blockquote>

    <p>“As issues come up I combat all of them,” she said. “Political parties or
      stances should not matter in regard to this issue.”</p>

    <p>Participants aimed to demand local leaders in NYC to commit to stop fossil fuel,
      shift to renewable energy and penalize corporate polluters.</p>

    <p>“We are here today to demand real solutions, particularly from our New York
      governor (Andrew) Cuomo and mayor (Bill) de Blasio,” said Lee Ziesche who is an
      organizer with Sane Energy and Seeding Sovereignty, which are two of the
      participating groups and organizers of the march.</p>
