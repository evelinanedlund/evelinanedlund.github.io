<p>Synagogues in South Brooklyn – home to one of the largest Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish populations outside of Israel – are reviewing their security policies after the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings on October 27 that killed 11 people.</p>

<p>In response to the Pittsburgh attack, the New York Police Department offered a presentation on preparing for active shooters on November 20. Among the hundreds of people who attended was Rabbi Heidi Hoover of Beth Shalom v’Emeth Reform Temple in Ditmas Park.</p>

<p>“They talked about security and what you can do if you find yourself in that terrible situation,” said Hoover, who also pointed out that most participants were Jewish. “After, I brought the information back to my congregation. We are in the beginning of discussing our security policies.”</p>

<p>The historic synagogue Ocean Parkway Jewish Center in Kensington has also reviewed its security policies and routines. Allen Michaels, its director and chairman, said he chose to not hold services in the main synagogue, moving them to another floor of the building because it would be easier to control exits and entrances.</p>

<blockquote>
“We are scared, but we are not going to let fear run our lives.”
</blockquote>

<p>Even though both Ocean Parkway and Beth Shalom have taken precautions, Hoover said she is trying to keep perspective.</p>

<p>“We are trying to keep in mind that this is something that is very unusual,” Hoover said. “We are scared, but we are not going to let fear run our lives.” </p>
